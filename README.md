# gerrymandering
Gerrymandering project for the 2020-21 STPF R Users AG. 


## Goal

The goal of this project is to create functionality in R to input a set of district boundaries and output metrics about them. 

[Here](http://www.ams.org/publicoutreach/feature-column/fc-2014-08) is an article from the American Mathematical Society about metrics for evaluating district shapes. 

[3 tests of partisan gerrymandering](http://www.stanfordlawreview.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2016/06/3_-_Wang_-_Stan._L._Rev.pdf), used by the [Princeton Gerrymandering project](https://gerrymander.princeton.edu/tests)

There are lots of metrics to evaluate district boundaries, from statistical, demographic, or purely mathematical perspective. Our first goal of this project is to collect those metrics here. 

Because we are in the DC area, and Virginia happens to have an anti-gerrymmandering amendment on the ballot in 2020, we will start with Virginia data.

## TODO

- Find other metrics 
- Put links here 
- Add found PDFs to the repo so others can read and easily access.
