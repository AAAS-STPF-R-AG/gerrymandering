Hi all,

Let's chat about the goings on in the woRld: symposium recap and data analysis, future of the AG, and more. 

R you ready to talk about R. Come learn what forcats is and why it's not fordogs? Do you want to talk about spatial || special data? Do you need frames for your tables? R you having trouble with tibbles? 

```{r}
pacman::p_load(pacman, tidyverse, lubridate)
dayOfMeeting <- mdy("07-28-2021")
timeOfMeeting <- "5:30pm" # could be included in date as mdy_hm
print(sprintf("The R Users AG will meet tomorrow, %s, Wednesday at %s, to talk about R.", dayOfMeeting, timeOfMeeting))
```
